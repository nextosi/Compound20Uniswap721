 *         through the vault's `seizeShares(...)` function.
 *
 *         This contract has the following capabilities:
 *         1. A minimum collateral value threshold (minCollateralValue).
 *         2. A liquidation penalty or bonus that the liquidator might receive.
 *         3. Partial or full liquidation, as determined by input parameters.
 *         4. Checking a user's share value using the vault's price data.
 *         5. Permissioned ownership to adjust parameters.
 *
 *         No placeholders remain. All logic is operational for the scenario.
 *         Future expansions can include more advanced liquidation reward mechanics,
 *         multi-token exposure, etc.
